### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for creating high-quality applications. Chasing my childhood dream to take over the world (or by just driving a Porsche 992 GT3). Proficient in ***React, NodeJS, MySQL, AWS, Vue.js, Python, C++, PHP and Lua***. Currently studying computer engineering and moonlighting as a motorsport enthusiast. 

Thank you for taking the time to view my profile, I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your projects.
